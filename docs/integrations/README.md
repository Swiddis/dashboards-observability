# OpenSearch Integrations

This is the developer documentation.
For user documentation, see [the OpenSearch website](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/integrations/).

*OpenSearch Integrations* is the entry point to consume observability data from third-party applications,
and get insights on it with OpenSearch.
We provide a framework and pre-configured asset bundles called Integrations to automatically organize the ingestion pipeline within OpenSearch.
With this, we provide valuable insights on metrics that matter with minimal configuration.

Some major moving parts include:
- Installation (Document Pending)
- [Catalogs](./catalogs/README.md)
